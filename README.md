# My attempt at a coded Climate Spiral showing global temperature anomalies between 1880 and 2024. 

A climate spiral is used to visualise monthly global temperature anomalies, these are changes from the average that was observed between 1951 to 1980. The blue demos colder temperatures than the average and the red shows higher than average temperatures.  

made following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVBTxnRyOuE&t=517s&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain) YouTube tutorial and with data downloaded from [NASA](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/).
